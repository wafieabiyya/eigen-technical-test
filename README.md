# Technical Test

This repository contains my submissions for a technical test. It consists of two parts:

1. **Algoritma (Algorithm Challenges)**  
   Folder: [`algoritma/`](./algoritma)  
   Contains solutions to programming and algorithmic problems using JavaScript.

2. **Frontend Challenge**  
   Folder: [`fe-challenge/`](./fe-challenge)  
   A small frontend application built using React, TypeScript, Ant Design, and Vite. This project demonstrates UI skills, API integration, component structure, and clean architecture.
